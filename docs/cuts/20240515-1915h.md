*A Tricky Issue*

In addition to the advances in computation already mentioned, one other ingredient is essential to our model's success in producing advice that matches people's behavior: Our use of data about people's actual beliefs.

This is crucial because of a longstanding tension in the literature.

When economists studying households' consumption/saving behavior estimate the relative risk aversion and time preference parameters that are consistent with household saving choices, they have long found that the model can fit the data with a moderate degree of risk aversion[^f7] and a moderate degree of present bias.[^f8] However, when models of portfolio choice are estimated in an attempt to match actual portfolio choice, they typically require extreme values of relative risk aversion[^f9] and require implausible time discounting.[^f10]

[^f7]: A CRRA of around 2, say.
[^f8]: A pure time preference factor of between 0.96 and 1.0
[^f9]: Say, above 10; see MVG JMP.
[^f10]: Say, $\beth = 0.6$ which implies that you care about your one-year-from-now self only 60 percent as much as you care about your current self.

Two facts have recently emerged that, together, make the model much more consistent with the data.

The first is new data from the New York Fed's _Survey of Consumer Expectations_ about people's perceptions of the amount of risk they face.

It turns out that economists' calibrations of the degree of noncapital income uncertainty greatly exceeds the amount of uncertainty that people report perceiving (see WangTao JMP). This is a case where the economists may well be wrong. Our method of computing uncertainty basically assumes that whenever income changes for reasons we economists cannot explain, the change is the consequence of a random shock (which rational people would need to take into account when planning how much to save). But income can change in ways that are perfectly predictable to the consumer based on information we economists do not see. For example, a person might take a long break from work for a long-planned round-the-world trip, which would look like an unexplainable random shock to the economist. 

Whether the economists are right or the survey respondents are right: As noted above, the decisions people make presumably depend upon their own perceptions and not whatever beliefs economists might impute to them. If people perceive much less risk than we economists thought, and yet still behave in ways that show considerable sensitivity to (small) amounts of risk, that suggests that they are more risk averse than we had thought.

The second new fact is that most people seem to believe that the stock market has both lower (log) returns and higher uncertainty than exhibited in the historical time series statistics that economists have traditionally used to impute beliefs to them. Their pessimism (relative to historical experience) provides a natural explanation for why so many people invest so little in the stock market: They think it is a bad deal.

Our model's ability to fit people's actual behavior (for both portfolio choice and consumption/saving decisions) better than models that do not take actual people's actual beliefs into account is further evidence that the academic approach has been on the right track in moving toward measuring beliefs (and using those measurements).

A tricky question remains. If, as economists who are deeply versed in the historical experience of market returns, we feel that the actual beliefs people hold are unduly pessimistic, what advice should we give people about how to invest? Financial advisors, of course, face the same question.

A helpful analogy might ease our concerns on this score. In very many domains of life, people put their trust in experts who know the relevant facts to make decisions. For example, even someone building their own new home, who feels quite capable of deciding questions about the orientation of the house or the size of the garage is expected to comply with the regulations of the electrical wiring code of their house. They are not expected to master the complexity behind the question of how wiring should be done to trade off safety and convenience in provision of electricity to the different parts of the house. The extent to which people feel the need to consult financial advisors (or to abide by pension and 401(k) rules devised by such advisors), the natural interpretation would seem to be that they think of questions like how much to save for retirement or how much to invest in stocks versus bonds as questions that should be answered by experts. Indeed, if financial advisors did not know any relevant facts that the household did know, and did not have any expertise about what to do with those facts to make a prudent saving and investment plan, why would the (enormous) financial consulting industry exist at all?

 Where that leaves us is with the view that the role of financial advisors (and the role of rigorous mathematical/computational life cycle modeling) is to provide people with the answers that they would themselves choose if they had the requisite knowledge and experience.
