               Our measure can be computed at negligible cost even for complex
               structural models. We argue that reporting this measure can
               increase the transparency of structural estimates, making it
               easier for readers to predict the way violations of identifying
               assumptions would affect the results. When the key assumptions
               are orthogonality between error terms and excluded instruments,
               we show that our measure provides a natural extension of the
               omitted variables bias formula for nonlinear models. We
               illustrate with applications to published articles in several

  abstract    = {This paper considers several alternative explanations for the
                 fact that households with higher levels of lifetime income (
                 the rich') have higher lifetime saving rates (Dynan, Skinner,
                 and Zeldes (1996); Lillard and Karoly (1997)). The paper
                 argues that the saving behavior of the richest households
                 cannot be explained by models in which the only purpose of
                 wealth accumulation is to finance future consumption, either
                 their own or that of heirs. The paper concludes that the
                 simplest model that explains the relevant facts is one in
                 which either consumers regard the accumulation of wealth as an
                 end in itself, or unspent wealth yields a flow of services
                 (such as power or social status) which have the same practical
                 effect on behavior as if wealth were intrinsically desirable.},

               cannot, and that adding earnings persistence within families
               increases wealth concentration even more. I also show that the

               and lifetime income, but also generates a skewed bequest

               and high earnings risk for the top earners) and argues that more

               the basic life-cycle model of saving. The observed patterns of
               out-of-pocket medical expenses, which rise quickly with age and

               explain a significant portion of US saving during retirement.

               bequests. Progress toward disentangling these motivations has

               and private insurance choices. An improved understanding of

  author    = {De Nardi, Mariacristina and Yang, Fang},
  abstract  = {This paper generates two main contributions. First, it provides
               a new theory of wealth inequality that merges two empirically
               relevant forces generating inequality: bequest motives and
               inheritance of ability across generations; and an earnings
               process that allows for more earnings risk for the richest.
               Second, it uses the resulting calibrated framework to study the
               effects of changing estate taxation. Increasing the estate tax
               reduces the wealth concentration in the hands of the richest few
               and the economic advantage of being born to a rich and
               super-rich family at the cost of reduced aggregate capital and
               output. However, all of these effects are quite small. In
               contrast, increasing estate taxation can generate a significant
               welfare gain to a newborn under the veil of ignorance, but this
               comes at a large welfare cost for the super-rich.},

  abstract  = {Why are some people wealthy while others are poor? To what
               extent can governments affect inequality? Which instruments
               should they use? Answering these questions requires
               understanding why people save. Dynamic quantitative models of
               wealth inequality can help us to understand and quantify the
               determinants of the outcomes that we observe in the data and to
               evaluate the consequences of policy reform. This paper surveys
               the savings mechanisms generated by the transmission of bequests
               and human capital, by preference heterogeneity, by rate of
               return heterogeneity, by entrepreneurship, by richer earnings
               processes, and by medical expenses. It concludes that the
               transmission of bequests and human capital, entrepreneurship,
               and medical-expense risk are crucial determinants of savings and

               accumulation: A new answer},
  author    = {Dynan, Karen E and Skinner, Jonathan and Zeldes, Stephen P},
  abstract  = {As the workhorse of consumption and saving research for the past
               four decades, the life-cycle model has proved flexible and
               useful for examining a variety of questions. In a classic paper,
               Albert Ando and Franco Modigliani (1963 p. 56) stated a key
               assumption of the basic model: ``[t]he individual neither
               expects to receive nor desires to leave any inheritance.''
               Although the authors contended that the absence of a bequest
               motive was not critical to the heart of their results, the
               assumption set off a long-standing battle over the relative
               importance of different motives for saving. In an influential
               study, Laurence Kotlikoff and Laurence Summers (1981) estimated
               that a large fraction of the U.S. capital stock was attributable
               to intergenerational transfers. Modigliani and his collaborators
               vigorously disagreed and, based on their own empirical work,
               claimed that life-cycle saving was the primary source of capital
               accumulation (Modigliani, 1988). Subsequent work has failed to
               reach a consensus. Since this debate began, an important advance
               in the consumption literature has been the incorporation of
               uncertainty in life-cycle models (see e.g., R. Glenn Hubbard et
               al., 1995). We argue that allowing for uncertainty resolves the
               controversy over the importance of life-cycle and bequest saving
               by showing that these motives for saving are overlapping and
               cannot generally be distinguished. A dollar saved today
               simultaneously serves both a precautionary life-cycle function
               (guarding against future contingencies such as health shocks or

               event that the dollar is not absorbed by these contingencies, it
               will be available to bequeath to children or other worthy
               causes. Under this view, households have a bequest motive, but
               bequests are given (i.e., the motive is ``operative'') in only
               some states of the world. Wealth is something like traveler's
               checks: you take them along on vacation ``just in case,'' but
               odds are they will remain uncashed and available for sundry
               goods after the journey is complete. We first demonstrate the
               result using a simple model and then argue that this approach
               reconciles the apparent importance of bequests with households'
               declared focus on life-cycle saving. Finally, we consider
               implications of our analysis.},

               in the 1950s and 1960s, and while not resolved, it remains
               central to the evaluation of tax and macroeconomic policies. We
               resolve this long?standing question using new empirical methods

               having a will increases with age, 30 percent of individuals aged
               70 plus are without a will and, of the HRS respondents who died

                 salvo in a long running debate over the importance of
                 intergenerational transfers in explaining savings behavior.
                 While Modigliani corrects an algebraic error of minor
                 consequences in our earlier paper, its correction does not, in
                 our view, call into question the fundamental conclusion that
                 life cycle considerations can account for only a small part of
                 aggregate capital accumulation. Inevitably, it is possible to
                 challenge aspects of any complex empirical calculation.
                 Modigliani's attacks seem to us incorrect in most cases and
                 generally fail to address our primary method of determining
                 the importance of intergenerational transfers. Many

               long-term care insurance. In this paper, I find that retirees'
               saving and insurance choices are highly inconsistent with
               standard life-cycle models in which people care only about their
               own consumption but match well models in which bequests are
               luxury goods. Bequest motives tend to reduce the value of
               insurance by reducing the opportunity cost of precautionary
               saving. The results suggest that bequest motives significantly
               increase saving and significantly decrease purchases of
               long-term care insurance and annuities.},

We use this measure, which we call “annualized comprehensive wealth,” to investigate spend-down behavior among a panel of older households in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) from 1998 to 2006. Our analysis indicates that for most retired households, comprehensive wealth balances decline much more slowly than their remaining life expectancies, so that the predominate trend is for real annualized wealth to rise significantly with age over the course of retirement. Comparing the estimated age profiles for annualized wealth with profiles simulated from several different life-cycle models, we find that a model that takes into account uncertain longevity, random medical expenses, and intended bequests lines up best with the broad patterns of rising annualized wealth in the HRS.}
