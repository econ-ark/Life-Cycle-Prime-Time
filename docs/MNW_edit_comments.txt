NEEDS WRITING:

- "even early in their working lives the primary motivation for saving is for the accumulation of a bequest" --> need to check what I meant by this
- need to provide more details in calibration; I don't know where everything comes from
- add 1-2 sentences justifying beta=1 vs literature
- need to expand on Aboagye and what their results are
- need to expand on late life risks a bit more


CODE / MODEL PROBLEMS:

- where in the code is the expenditure shocks in retirement?
- why doesn't the code hold the retirement moments constant at 10?
- do we actually want to hold wealth ratio constant at 10?
- do we want to use subjective beliefs?
- do we want age-varying beta adjusters?
- weighting is normally *outside* of the square, but fine


NEED TO DISCUSS:

- re-raise fight about spacecraft
- "implausibly intense" bequest motive --> I really disagree
- exponential discounting or geometric discounting?
- wait, do we match median portfolio shares? or are we matching some recommendations?
- age-aggregated data can be noisy --> what?
- selection bias what?
- what is this "bias in the estimation process"
