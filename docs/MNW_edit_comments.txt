NEEDS WRITING:

4) add 1-2 sentences justifying beta=1 vs literature
5) "even early in their working lives the primary motivation for saving is for the accumulation of a bequest" --> need to check what I meant by this


CODE / MODEL QUESTIONS:

- what interest parameters do we want to use, and why?
- why not match risky asset shares for entire lifecycle?
- where in the code is the expenditure shocks in retirement?
- why doesn't the code hold the retirement moments constant at 10?
- do we actually want to hold wealth ratio constant at 10?
- do we want to condition SCF on college?
- do we want to use subjective beliefs?
- do we want age-varying beta adjusters?
- where did PermGroFac = 0.9389 come from?
- weighting is normally *outside* of the square, but fine


NEED TO DISCUSS:

- re-raise fight about spacecraft
- "implausibly intense" bequest motive --> I really disagree
- age-aggregated data can be noisy --> what?
- selection bias what?
- what is this "bias in the estimation process"
