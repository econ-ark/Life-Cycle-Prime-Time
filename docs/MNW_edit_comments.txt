NEEDS WRITING:

5) "even early in their working lives the primary motivation for saving is for the accumulation of a bequest" --> need to check what I meant by this


CODE / MODEL QUESTIONS:

- what interest parameters do we want to use, and why? 2.5 or 3% EqPrem
- why not match risky asset shares for entire lifecycle? it's about wealth drawdown
- where in the code is the expenditure shocks in retirement? it was missing
- why doesn't the code hold the retirement moments constant at 10? throw it out
- do we actually want to hold wealth ratio constant at 10? no
- do we want to condition SCF on college? yes
- do we want to use subjective beliefs? sort of
- do we want age-varying beta adjusters? no
- where did PermGroFac = 0.9389 come from? it's from CGM, use 15% instead
- weighting is normally *outside* of the square, but fine


NEED TO DISCUSS:

- "implausibly intense" bequest motive --> I really disagree
