# Master/source files that should be indexed more thoroughly
# These files are the canonical source of truth and should receive
# much higher priority in search results and more detailed indexing
master_files:
  # The master documents for the paper are written in Markdown
  - "*.md"
  # The canonical, consolidated list of all project macros

# Source file relationships (files that generate other files)
# This helps prioritize source files over their generated outputs

  # Markdown files generate PDF, LaTeX, and DOCX files
  - source: "*.md"
    generates:

      - "*.docx"
  # math-macros.yml generates local-shortcuts.sty and local-shortcuts.yml
  - source: "tools/math-macros.yml"
